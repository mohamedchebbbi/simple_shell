.SH NAME
simple_shell - a shell (standard command line interpreter)
.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH DESCRIPTION
The hsh utility reads and interprets a command line string, either in interactive or non-interactive mode. It then executes commands based on the input.  Both the local directory and PATH are searched.
When applicable, the  function prints to stdout or stderr, the standard output and error stream, respectively.
In interactive mode, the shell will prompt with \' $ \', and proess the entered input upon a return stroke.  In non-interactive mode, standard output must be piped into the executable.
